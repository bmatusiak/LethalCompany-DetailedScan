# DetailedScan
Type `detailed` in the terminal when landed at a moon to bring up a list of all of the scrap still remaining outside of the ship, and their individual value.
`det` also work due to the nature of how the terminal works.
`ds` can now also be used.

If you are not the host, item values in the detailed scan may appear as all '0' until the ship lands. 
If this happens, just back out of the terminal and re-enter the command.

Works with version 45!
